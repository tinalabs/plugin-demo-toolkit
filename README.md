# Welcome to the react tinacms documentation toolkit

## Getting started 

1. Create a new docs site: `npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/tinalabs/plugin-doc-toolkit/tree/master/packages/example-site-next docs`

2. Then navigate to the docs site: `cd docs`

3. And start the dev server and follow the on-screen instructions: `npm run dev`

You can see further instructions for getting started and using the toolkit in the [documentation](https://tinalabs.github.io/tinacms-doc-toolkit/).

> This toolkit comes pre-configured to deploy to Github pages, with a Github actions workflow stored in the `.github` folder.
>
> If you create a new Github repository with this site, it will automatically deploy to Github pages.
